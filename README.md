# Schachbrett_VoiceControll
## Introduction

This repository contains all the code, 3d models and documentation used for building a chessboard controlled by the voice from scratch.
Everybody can use it to build their own but make sure to give credits to the [original owners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2266282) of the STL Files used to print parts of coreXY.
